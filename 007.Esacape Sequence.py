# \ is the KEY
# use \ before any quotes in a string (IN PRINT FUNCTION) or there is a risk of getting an error
# there are more actually
# \" -- Simple double quote
# \' -- Simple single quote
# \\ -- Simple SINGLE Backslash
# \n -- New line in display without an new line in code
# \t -- space of tab between the spaces
# \b -- a backspace

# Experiment (RESPECTIVELY)

print("here \" does not count as a double quote")
print('it\'s an quote in a quote')
print("yay a backslash \\")
print("new line\nwithout a new line")
print("does it seem\tlike a space over there?")
print("ooo\bpps a spelling mistake? that was well calculated LOL")
